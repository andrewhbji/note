** These routines provide an easy way to make any type of
** data-structure thread-aware.  Simply associate a data_control
** structure with the data structure (by creating a new struct, for
** example).  Then, simply lock and unlock the mutex, or
** wait/signal/broadcast on the condition variable in the data_control
** structure as needed.
**
** data_control structs contain an int called "active".  This int is
** intended to be used for a specific kind of multithreaded design,
** where each thread checks the state of "active" every time it locks
** the mutex.  If active is 0, the thread knows that instead of doing
** its normal routine, it should stop itself.  If active is 1, it
** should continue as normal.  So, by setting active to 0, a
** controlling thread can easily inform a thread work crew to shut
** down instead of processing new jobs.  Use the control_activate()
** and control_deactivate() functions, which will also broadcast on
** the data_control struct's condition variable, so that all threads
** stuck in pthread_cond_wait() will wake up, have an opportunity to
** notice the change, and then terminate.
